# PyTimer
This repository is simple timer app which is written using ***Python language***. It is neccessary when you need to countdown time for some important things.
## If the time has gone:
- PyTimer will be opened upper other your apps windows
- PyTimer will make the sound that the time has gone
## Usage
The usage is very easy. Just follow these simple steps:
1. Enter amount of minutes of time you want to countdown in the ***"Minutes" input field***
2. Enter amount of seconds in the ***"Seconds" input field***
3. Press ***"Start timer" button***
## Issue
if you want to enter only minutes or only seconds (not both things), PyTymer won't get started. This is because the opposite field isn't filled. If you need to fill only one field, then you'll enter 0 in opposite field. ***For example:***
`Minutes: 20
Seconds: 0`
